# Tennis-Ball-Tracking
Combining simple video analysis algorithms to track tennis ball and players in match videos. 

## Sample Videos
The sample videos can be accessed through this [folder](

## How to Run
The code consists of Colab Notebooks. The main algorithm (with the best performance) is in the file [BallTrackingandScorePrediction_KalmanFilter.ipynb](https://github.com/MinahilRaza/Tennis-Ball-Tracking/blob/main/BallTrackingandScorePrediction_KalmanFilter.ipynb). The notebook can be uploaded to colab along with the videos to reproduce the results.
